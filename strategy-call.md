<h1 class="join-us">Free Real Estate Business Planning Call</h1>
<h5 class="join-us-subtitle">Are you a hungry real estate agent looking for more?</h5>

<p>Dear Fellow Agent:</p>

<p>Need direction and focus to sell more homes?</p>

<p>I’ll meet with you one-on-one to help you write a business plan you can implement immediately to generate leads, appointments, and sales. </p>

<p>I know how challenging it is to sell real estate.</p>

<p>You have discount brokerages, competing agents, and hundreds of ways to get clients (all are not equal, I’ll tell you).</p>

<p>It can get overwhelming to stick to a consistent business plan that makes you money.</p>

<p>My name is Josh Anderson with The Anderson Group Real Estate Services and we’ve sold over a thousand homes. </p>

<p>I want to help you sell more homes.</p>

<p>I’ll learn about your needs, goals, and why you started selling real estate. I’m happy to offer my insight on what I would do in your situation to sell more homes.</p>

<p>I will also share with you what we’re doing that works to generate leads and sales. </p>

<p>Once I understand how you like to do business that’s authentic to you (referral, prospecting, marketing, events, etc), I’ll help you write a business plan tailored just for you.</p>

<p>You’ll walk away with a plan of action, with steps you can take right away, to find homeowners who will list their home with you. </p>

<p>This will help you get the commission consistency and the freedom we all want from our business.</p>

<p class="section-title">Here’s what a few agents say about working with me…</p>

<p><span class="quote">"Josh and the lead agents training were catalysts in reaching my maximum potential and taking my business where I never thought it could go. The hands on training allowed me to learn with each and every transaction on how to do things the right way with the best outcome for our clients. Josh and the team prove that the sky's the limit if you work hard and follow the systems."</span><br>

<p><span class="quote">"Josh's Training has helped me take my business to the next level, and I am so grateful"</span><br>
<span class="author">- Caroline Rosenberg</span></p>

<p><span class="quote">"Nashville is one of the hottest real estate markets in the country.  The Anderson Group not only trained me on basic real estate knowledge, but even more important- they taught me how to succeed by winning not just clients, but offers in such a competitive market.
It takes more than what you see on HGTV to become a real estate agent.  The Anderson Group trained me on the “not-so-glamorous” side of real estate industry that ultimately lead me to being a top agent in the greater Nashville area. With the mentorship, hands on training and support of senior members, my success has skyrocketed.
Did you know that 90% of homes in Middle Tennessee are sold by only 5% of real estate agents in Middle Tennessee?** The Anderson Group has trained me to be one of those agents in the top 5%.  Their attentiveness, hands on learning and elite training system has taken my business to levels I could not have imagined.

<p>You don’t need to pay a bunch of money to a real estate coach.</p>

<p>Why am I offering this?</p>

<p>I’ll help you for free in return that maybe, over the long term – and only if it makes sense - you’d like to learn more about working with our team.</p>

<p>Let me be clear that is not the intent of the meeting. That’s another conversation for another time and only if you have any interest.</p>

<p>I also figure we’ll do business together someday and I would like to get to know you. I enjoy seeing real estate agents succeed. It’s fulfilling, and I love it.</p>

<p>I invite you to request a free one-on-one business strategy meeting with me. We can meet for coffee, or even if it’s more convenient, a phone call or a video conference works, too.</p>

<p>I have a questionnaire I would like you to fill out so that when we meet so I’m prepared to offer you specific advice. When you request a call, I’ll email it to you to complete before the meeting.</p>

<p>Look forward to meeting with you. Let’s grow your business.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Josh Anderson</p>
