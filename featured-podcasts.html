<a href="https://realestateuncensored.libsyn.com/how-josh-anderson-generated-48-deals-last-year-from-agent-referrals" target="_blank">How Josh Anderson Generated 48 Deals Last Year From Agent Referrals</a>

<p>Josh Anderson’s real estate team pulled off 239 deals, $81 million in volume and agent referrals made a 73% dent in their database. What are the tactics and resources that have made these results possible? On this episode we dive into agent referral systems, client events and team building and reveal how they are connected to this team’s success.
When agents refer you they want to know that their client will be taken care of. -Josh Anderson
Takeaways + Tactics
Once Josh’s team got specialized everyone became more efficient, more productive and made more money.
If you’re always coming from contribution no one will just tell you no.
In the real estate industry we’re probably going to see more top producers joining teams.
At the start of the show, Josh Anderson told us about his business, and how he built his database. He believes in making calls, and learning not to fear getting no for an answer. Next, he shared some details on his team and how they generate natural referrals. His business became more specialized when he was able to hire talent to take on some of the work for him. People in the industry realize how difficult it is to find talented people with a work ethic, good attitude and common sense, and that’s why top producers are now more likely to join teams that possess that kind of talent. We went onto discuss the inbound and outbound process for ISAs, client events, how he kickstarted his agent referral network and how he keeps in touch with them and provides value.
The success of a database for agent referrals leans heavily on the value you provide. When you provide agents a glimpse of what you’ll do for their clients, they will be more inclined to make that referral. Come from a place of contribution, constantly make your systems better and cultivate long term relationships.

<a href="http://masterclassrealestateacademy.com/" target="_blank"><h4>Real Estate Real World</h4></a>

<p>It was an absolute pleasure speaking to Josh Anderson this week! He and his team are located in the Nashville, Tennessee area and they are KILLING it when it comes to agent referrals. Last year alone, they closed 48 transactions from agent referrals around the country. WOW!</p>

<p>How do you get that many referrals from other agents? It helps when you live in a desirable area that many people are moving to. However, networking and keeping in contact with his database are things that he is <p>dedicating his time to each month, which most agents push aside.</p>

Making calls, knocking on doors, sending newsletters to your database…these are all basics when it comes to lead generation, but it’s usually the first thing to go when business picks up.</p></p>

<p>In Episode 7, Josh Anderson, of the Josh Anderson Real Estate Group, speaks with Nick Baldwin, host of Real Estate Rewind. Anderson describes what led him to leave the banking industry and how he found success in real estate by mastering the basics. He will inspire you to abandon shiny object syndrome in favor of building your business through consistent hard work. Episode Highlights: Josh Anderson began his career in investment banking. He didn’t have a mentor and didn’t feel he was growing.He got into real estate because he wanted to buy an investment property. That didn’t work out, but getting his license did.Anderson recently advised an intern about how important it is to find a mentor to learn from.He initially had misinformation about being a realtor but it ended up being a perfect fit.In his first year, he succeeded because he helped wherever he could and listened to conversations people were having around him.Anderson utilized his own database using a simple spreadsheet. He shares his early process for following up with leads.They discuss shiny object syndrome in the real estate industry.Anderson reveals the early mistakes he made as he built-out his team.They explore motivation and how it affects different team members.Former members of Anderson’s team have left, but were trained so well that they have thriving businesses of their own.Anderson loves seeing former team members succeed.They discuss the value of a P&L statement.Anderson’s business is 75% sphere of influence and 25% video and other leads.His team has a high profit margin because they know their database.Having a highly visible office was a factor in increasing his team’s average price point.Another way to increase your average price point is to work expired listings in very targeted areas.Additionally, former first-time buyers are moving up, which increases the average price point.Anderson’s team does not farm geographically.They try to genuinely connect with likeminded people.Anderson is still in production but enjoys team-building most.Doing things repetitively and consistently is boring but it will bring you success.Never give up future business for business you already have.Anderson describes what it was like talking about his business, on stage, with Gary Keller.. 3 Key Points:Josh Anderson started his career in investment banking but felt his growth was stalled. When he earned his license he approached the business with the desire to learn. Even if it sounds boring, working hard and working smart is how you succeed in this business.Master the basics and put good processes in place.</p>
