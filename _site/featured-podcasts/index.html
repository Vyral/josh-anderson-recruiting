<a href="https://realestateuncensored.libsyn.com/how-josh-anderson-generated-48-deals-last-year-from-agent-referrals" target="_blank">How Josh Anderson Generated 48 Deals Last Year From Agent Referrals</a>

<p>Josh Anderson’s real estate team pulled off 239 deals, $81 million in volume and agent referrals made a 73% dent in their database. What are the tactics and resources that have made these results possible? On this episode we dive into agent referral systems, client events and team building and reveal how they are connected to this team’s success.
When agents refer you they want to know that their client will be taken care of. -Josh Anderson
Takeaways + Tactics
Once Josh’s team got specialized everyone became more efficient, more productive and made more money.
If you’re always coming from contribution no one will just tell you no.
In the real estate industry we’re probably going to see more top producers joining teams.
At the start of the show, Josh Anderson told us about his business, and how he built his database. He believes in making calls, and learning not to fear getting no for an answer. Next, he shared some details on his team and how they generate natural referrals. His business became more specialized when he was able to hire talent to take on some of the work for him. People in the industry realize how difficult it is to find talented people with a work ethic, good attitude and common sense, and that’s why top producers are now more likely to join teams that possess that kind of talent. We went onto discuss the inbound and outbound process for ISAs, client events, how he kickstarted his agent referral network and how he keeps in touch with them and provides value.
The success of a database for agent referrals leans heavily on the value you provide. When you provide agents a glimpse of what you’ll do for their clients, they will be more inclined to make that referral. Come from a place of contribution, constantly make your systems better and cultivate long term relationships.
