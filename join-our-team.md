Dear Real Estate Agent:

I understand that you may be interested in a career in real estate or are an experienced agent. Perhaps you’ve been in the industry for a couple of years and have been successful thus far, but you find yourself lacking the kind of consistency, income, and support you desire.

For some people, this can be painful. In fact, a lack of sufficient training, education, and accountability lead to many agents leaving the industry altogether. There’s lots of misinformation out there, especially for new agents. **Studies show that 87% of agents actually leave real estate within the first two years of getting their license.**

Agents like this run out of money, get distracted, and fall flat in their career due to a lack of support and a lack of proper guidance.

This leads to a lot of uncertainty and stress. People have no idea whether they will see another paycheck after their next contract. And of the insufficient and inconsistent income they may be producing now, how much of it is going right back into paying for marketing expenses and other costs not covered by their brokerage? Ultimately, these agents are miserable and constantly riding the real estate rollercoaster.

The truth is, some agents just aren’t prepared for the industry. They develop bad habits that end up killing their career. On my team, we ensure that our agents are given the tools, systems, training, and support they need to be successful and reach their goals. We hold our agents accountable. When we see potential in an agent, we expect that agent to use it.

I’m Josh Anderson and I’ve gone through all of this. I’ve made all the mistakes, spent all the money, and at the end of the day, I eventually created systems and processes that work in this industry. My junior agent program teaches new agents what they need to learn from the people who know what it takes to succeed.

**No other team in Nashville is able to provide for their agents at the level we do.** We offer help in the form of:

* High-quality scripts
* Lead generation
* Database management
* Knowing your numbers
* Knowing how to create and stick to a daily schedule with time blocking

We give our agents every opportunity to learn, grow, take on leads, and, ultimately, close transactions. We teach our agents how to love their career and make money without giving away their lives. Our agents can make six figures while also maintaining the all-important work-life balance.

In short, you could continue at your current pace — making inconsistent income, paying for your own marketing and advertising expenses, and having little freedom in your life and career. You could also simply quit and take on a 9-to-5 job where you have no flexibility and no fun. Or, you could take the first step on the road to success and join my team.

Once you join us, the work starts right away. Our onboarding process will include:

* Extensive training
* Creating your database
* Meeting with the Director of Operations
* Learning all of the team roles
* Going on listing appointments
* First-hand training and mentorship

Don’t just take my word for it. Stefanie has been on our team for nine years. She started out as a showing specialist, but has since become our lead buyer’s agent and is making very good money. For the last five years, she’s made between $175,000 and $275,000 per year.

Caroline started as an ISA with us seven years ago. In her first year, she made $24,000, but last year she made $280,000. She’s increased her salary tenfold in just six years.

**Now is the time to turn around your life and career.** If you are a motivated individual who wants to learn all the necessary systems and processes to build a successful real estate business, please apply today.

I look forward to talking with you soon.

Josh Anderson
