2020 is just beginning, but if you’re having trouble getting your real estate business launched and set up for success in the new year, fear not: You’re officially invited to Focus Day 2020 on Thursday, Jan 30, at the Green Hills Library. The work you do now will pay dividends in the second and third quarters of this year, and this real estate business planning clinic will guide you on how to set goals and achieve them. You can RSVP for Focus Day 2020 by **[using this link.](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/real-estate-business-planning-clinic-tickets-75302005325)** If you have any questions at all, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I look forward to seeing you there.
