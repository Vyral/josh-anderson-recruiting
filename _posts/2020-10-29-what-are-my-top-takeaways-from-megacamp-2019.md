I recently had the pleasure of attending MegaCamp 2019, and I want to share my top takeaways from this experience:

\-Don’t settle—settlers get slaughtered

\-If you don't think bigger, you will undoubtedly have an average life. Small thinking = small hires = small life

\-The path is in the math. Everything in life traces back to numbers, so know your numbers

\-You can take your hands off, but you can’t take your eyes off

\-You don’t have to be great to start, but you DO have to start to be great\! Just do it\! Perfection is massively overrated

\-Don't think about what's realistic or not; only think in terms of what's possible

\-We don’t fail because of what we don't know; we fail because of what we know and don’t do

In addition to learning these points, I also had the opportunity to speak on stage with Gary Keller himself for a wide-ranging talk about the progression of my career and how my team got to the point where they’re poised to break the $100 million mark in 2019. To see our full discussion, watch this video.
