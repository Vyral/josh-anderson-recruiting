We have a couple excellent job opportunities.

&nbsp;

1\. We are looking for a new Senior Real Estate Consultant to join our team. This job is not for you unless you have grit, you are coachable, and you are a self-starter. Unless you are humble. Unless you are hungry for success, and know that failure simply isn't an option for you. Most of all, you should feel like you have something to prove, and want to grow with our company. This candidate is driven by an intrinsic desire to get better every day, just because they can.

2\. We are looking to add a Real Estate Investment Specialist to our team. If you have worked with Real Estate investment properties, or have a background in business management or finance, this job might be for you. This person will identify and present potential properties to clients, help them understand cash flow potential, and ultimately provide advice on whether or not a property is an ideal investment given the client's financial goals. In the past, our Investment Specialist has worked with clients interested in Airbnb property acquisitions, other rental properties, and targeted flips.
