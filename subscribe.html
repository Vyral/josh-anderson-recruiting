<p>Our goal is to give you a taste of the training we provide if you have any interest in working with us in the future.</p>

<p>We have no intention of recruiting you - that’s a conversation with us when you are ready, if at all.</p>

<p>The same training they get will help you do it as well.</p>

<p><strong>Here’s what a few agents say about our free training:</strong></p>

<p class="testimonial-text indent">"Josh and the lead agents training were catalysts in reaching my maximum potential and taking my business where I never thought it could go. The hands on training allowed me to learn with each and every transaction on how to do things the right way with the best outcome for our clients. Josh and the team prove that the sky's the limit if you work hard and follow the systems." <span class="testimonial-author">- Bestune Bekhtyar, Real Estate Consultant</span></p>

<p class="testimonial-text indent">"Josh's Training has helped me take my business to the next level, and I am so grateful" <span class="testimonial-author">- Caroline Rosenberg, Real Estate Consultant</span></p>

<p class="testimonial-text indent">"Nashville is one of the hottest real estate markets in the country. The Anderson Group not only trained me on basic real estate knowledge, but even more important- they taught me how to succeed by winning not just clients, but offers in such a competitive market. It takes more than what you see on HGTV to become a real estate agent. The Anderson Group trained me on the “not-so-glamorous” side of real estate industry that ultimately led me to being a top agent in the greater Nashville area. With the mentorship, hands on training and support of senior members, my success has skyrocketed. Did you know that 90% of homes in Middle Tennessee are sold by only 5% of real estate agents in Middle Tennessee?** The Anderson Group has trained me to be one of those agents in the top 5%. Their attentiveness, hands on learning and elite training system has taken my business to levels I could not have imagined." <span class="testimonial-author">- Stefanie Schmitz Ainslie, Real Estate Consultant</span></p>

<p>Most importantly, everything you receive is designed to start a conversation. So, if you have any questions about selling real estate you can email me at <a href="mailto:Josh@JoshAndersonRealEstate.com">Josh@JoshAndersonRealEstate.com</a>. </p>

<p>I’ll first answer your question by email, and if I think it would be of benefit to more people, I’ll answer it in a video.</p>

<p>We look forward to staying in touch. Let’s raise the standard and training of all real estate agents in Nashville.</p>
